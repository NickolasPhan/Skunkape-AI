To run this, you need to install the old version of the AIITK plugin (for UE 5.4). A compiled version exists on Nick's computer and the IronKey.
How to install the old AIITK plugin:
1. Copy old compiled AIITK plugin to your device.
2. Navigate to C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace
3. If you have the current version of the AIITK plugin, delete it.
4. Copy and paste the compiled AIITK plugin folder "AIIntegrationToolkit" to this directory.
5. If the project launches but things don't work, try restarting your PC.

Install these plugins inside the Epic Games Launcher:
1. 35 AR VR Southeastern US Plants and Ecosystems
2. Mediterranean Coast
3. Sasquatch
